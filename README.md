**three.quarks** is a high-performance javascript particle system library for threejs written in modern **TypeScript**.

### Difference from Physics Engines

Most physics engines bundles all the physics related data structure and 
algorithm together. It makes setup easy but it limits the flexibility of
the application or games. Because in lots of scenario except physics simulation,
objects are not intended to move according to physics laws.

This library is much light weight than a physics engine, and gives users a customizable
environment to setup their own 2d world.
